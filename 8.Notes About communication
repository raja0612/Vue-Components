1. Parent to Child  component communication.

In Parent component.
<child-component :name="data property or value"></child-component>

In child component:

receive the parent passed values as props. props may be array or object

props: ['name must match  with parent component'].

From child to parent.

1. emit the event.

this.$event('eventName', data)

In parent component listen to that event.

<child-component @eventName="(data == $event) or method($event)"

2 . In Vue ,Component Communication is done through Parent to Child but not Child to Child components directly.

So In order to communicate with child to child component , we need follow this way

Firstly, Parent send some call back function to one of it's child as prop and then child component
use that call back function to send data to parent.

secondly, again parent component send that data as prop to it's other child.

Thirdly,using Event Bus.
