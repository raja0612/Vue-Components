    <div id="app">
        Component 1 : <global-component></global-component>
        Component 2 : <global-component></global-component>
    </div>
    <div>
        Here we have two components called Component 1 and Component 2 
        but these two components are using same object in memory called person (look in app.js).
        Here I cheated Vue Component because vue component data must be object.
        Even if I click on Change Name button in one place, it is updating name on two components.
        So thats not valid criteria, because each component should maintain their own data in memory.

        Thats why Vue suggests that the data must be function return, so each component maintain thier own 
        data in memory and it not conflicts with other components data.
    </div>
    <hr>
    The solution for above problem is Vue component must return data in function.
    Here Clicking on Change Name button  changes name on respective component.
    <div id="app2">
        Component 1 : <my-component></my-component>
        Component 2 : <my-component></my-component>
    </div>
   
    <script src="app.js"></script>
